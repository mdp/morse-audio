/**
 * SNR-calibrated signal/noise mixing.
 *
 * The convention in radio engineering is that SNR is specified in a reference
 * noise bandwidth (typically 2.5 kHz for SSB-class measurements). When the
 * receiver's IF filter is narrower than the reference, less noise gets through
 * but the (in-band) signal stays put — so the *effective* SNR climbs. That's
 * the well-known "narrow CW filter pulls signals out of the noise" effect.
 *
 * These helpers implement that model in three composable pieces:
 *
 *   1. {@link generateCalibratedNoise} — produces atmospheric noise pre-filtered
 *      to a reference bandwidth and peak-normalized to a target level. The
 *      peak amplitude after this step is the "noise floor" reference.
 *
 *   2. {@link mixWithCalibratedNoise} — combines a clean signal with that noise
 *      using AGC-style behavior: the signal is scaled by 10^(snrDb/20), the
 *      noise floor stays put, and the final mix is peak-normalized so the
 *      loudest sample always lands at the same playback volume. High SNR →
 *      noise drops away. Low SNR → signal sinks under the noise.
 *
 *   3. {@link peakNormalize} — the in-place utility used by the above. Exposed
 *      for callers building custom pipelines.
 *
 * The classic `applyRadioEffects(samples, sampleRate, { qrn })` helper uses a
 * different (older) convention where the noise amplitude scales with SNR while
 * the signal stays fixed. Both conventions are mathematically valid, but the
 * AGC-calibrated one matches what an operator actually hears on a real radio.
